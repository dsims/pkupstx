pkupstx (pickupsticks) was pitched at Semantic Seed's Atlanta Startup Camp as a "foursquare for products".
Over the weekend, the idea was studied and a proof-of-concept was created. This is that code.

It was intended for mobile browsers and has typical social networking functionality:
-Users can follow and be followed.
-Users see the posts (topics) from people they follow.
-Users can also subscribe to a product to see all posts about it.
-Products and Users can be placed into lists so you only see posts from that list.
-Users can post to a Product's page (aka message board), or to your own or another user's board. Posts to users can be public or private. 
-Users can find a product by search or by scanning a barcode (the SCAN button launches the Android barcode app). 
-Users can add new products by manually entering details or scanning a barcode.
-Users can signify that they own or want a product.
-Users can review a product and give it a rating.
-All user activities are logged and achievements can be given based on activity.

It was adapted from the code of http://digibutter.nerr.biz and http://digi.vg .... gaming-focused socialnetwork/messageboard sites.
Most of the quirky digibutter and gaming stuff was ripped out, but you will probably notice some remnants ("products" are "games") and references to other features like openid/rpx and embedded urls.

Dependencies are KohanaPHP 2.3 http://docs.kohanaphp.com/ and MySQL and jQuery Mobile
